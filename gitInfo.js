/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does. 
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitDefinition = "Git is a version management software. It allows users to track the modification to their software."
//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

//CODE HERE
let gitHubDefinition = "GitHub is a website. It allows users a place to create online repositories for their code. This allows for similar version tracking as provided by Git, but also enables easier collaboration"
//////////////////PROBLEMS 3 - 8////////////////////
/*
    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'init' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the init command.
*/

//CODE HERE
const init = {
    description: "creates a new Git repository",
    code: "git init <directory>"
};

//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'clone' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the clone command.
*/

//CODE HERE
const clone = {
    description: "points to an existing repository and makes a clone/copy in another location",
    code: "git clone <repo> <directory>"
};

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'status' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the status command.
*/

//CODE HERE
const status = {
    description: "returns the state of the working directory and staging area",
    code: "git status"
};

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'add' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the add command.
*/

//CODE HERE
const add = {
    description: "adds a change in the working directory to the staging area",
    code: "git add ."
};

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'commit' with 'description' and 'code' properties
    following the guidelines above to describe the commit command.
*/

//CODE HERE
const commit = {
    description: "captures a snapshot of the project's current staged changes",
    code: "git commit -am <commit message>"
};

//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'push' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the push command.
*/

//CODE HERE
const push = {
